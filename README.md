Copyright can be defined as the right to copy something. It gives an author control over who can use or reproduce his or her creative work. Do not confuse owning a copy of a work with the right to make a copy of that work.

Copyright is automatic. As soon as you create something, you own the copyright and have legal control over how it's used, regardless of whether a copyright notice is displayed or not.

Things that fall under copyright include:Copyright Symbol
Literary works.
Sound recordings, musical works and lyrics.
Dramatic works and motion pictures.
Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.
Things that do not fall under copyright include:
Common knowledge.
Ideas, concepts, procedures, and discoveries.
Data, ingredients, lists, calendars, and rulers.
Government publications.
Titles, logos, slogans, etc. (These may be registered under trademark law.)
Works that are out of copyright.
Copyright protects a creator's ability to:
Reproduce a work
Distribute copies
Create derivatives of a work
Perform or display a work publically

What is Public Domain?
Public domain works are those which can usually be copied and used without permission from the owner. Copyright generally expires after a certain period of time, which means that most titles before that time are in the public domain.

Works generally fall into public domain:

95 years after publication (if published before 1977)
70 years after the creator has died (if published after 1977)
95 years after publication or 120 years from creation if owned by a corporation (e.g. Disney), whichever comes first.
Please note that this is a general guideline. Copyright can be renewed and foreign works have different sets of copyright rules, so be sure to research each work carefully before assuming it is in the public domain.

What is Fair Use?
Fair Use is part of copyright law (Section 107) that determines the extent to which you may use or distribute a copyrighted work without requesting specific permission.

Fair use generally permits parts of a work to be used in the following examples:

Criticism or commentary
Parodies
Educational use to illustrate a lesson
Many instructors incorrectly assume this final bullet means that copyright does not apply to the classroom at all. Copyright law can be vague on what constitutes fair use, but it has established four factors as a basic rubric to judge.

Four Factors of Fair Use
Do not assume that citing a source or using it for educational purposes puts it under fair use. Copyright law is flexible, but four factors are weighed to determine whether copying material applies to fair use.

1. Purpose of the Use
Fair use is more likely to apply if the reason for its use is:

Noncommercial or nonprofit
Educational (teaching, scholarship, or research)
Commentary, criticism, parody, or news reporting
Preservation (e.g. storing a digital copy)
Transformative works (e.g. creating something new, with a different purpose from the original)
2. Nature of Original Work Used
Fair use is more likely to apply if the work being used is:

Purely factual, nonfiction, or educational
Published
Not a consumable product (e.g. standardized tests, workbooks)
3. Amount of Original Work Used
Fair use is more likely to apply if you use:

a smaller portion of the work (e.g. no more than 1 chapter, 1 article, or 10% of the work, as a rule of thumb)
a part of the work that does not define the work as creatively unique (e.g. not the "heart" of the work)
4. Effect on the Market of the Original Work
Fair use is more likely to apply if you:

can prove you have not deprived the owner of any income
copy a portion of out-of-print text or other work that no longer makes money from sold copies
Fair Use Examples
Keep in mind that every situation is different, so what may be permitted in one situation may not be acceptable in every situation. When in doubt, ask for permission.
